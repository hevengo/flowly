# Card display: calmer layout and user-chosen fields

Status: implemented 2026-10-19. Card: 任务卡片布局调整.

## 1. Problem

A board card grew one row or pill per feature: ticket key line, title, progress line, latest-output line, and a wrapping row of priority pill, type pill, tag chips, Needs you, waiting, workpad checks, workspace state, approvals, errors, running, unread, ideas, archived and legacy. In a 260 px column a busy card ran to 7–8 lines, and the things that need the user were mixed in with descriptive metadata.

## 2. Layout

Four tiers, top to bottom. Every tier is omitted when empty.

| Tier | Content | Style |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Meta | priority (Urgent/High/Low only), type, ticket key, tags (first two, then `+n`) | one wrapping row of small muted text with icons, no pills or chips; Urgent/High keep their colour |
| Title | task title, up to 3 lines | unchanged |
| Activity | one line of what the agent did, with its relative time | AI mark when it is the progress summary |
| Status | what needs the user and what is happening | signals as before |

- Urgent/High keep the left stripe; it follows the Priority field.
- Status order: Needs you, waiting on cards, approvals, errors, workspace problems, running, unread, workpad checks, ideas, Archived, Legacy.
- The accessibility label of the card is unchanged and always lists every fact, whatever is hidden.

## 3. Options (Settings → Cards)

Host-scoped (`board-view` settings), so every board on this device uses them.

| Option | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activity line (`cardActivity`) | `auto`: progress summary, else latest output · `progress` · `output` · `both` · `none` | `auto` |
| Priority, Type, Ticket, Tags, Session activity, Workpad checks, Ideas | shown / hidden (`cardHidden`: list of hidden field ids) | all shown |

- Session activity covers running, starting, unread, session count, Loading… and Last known. Approvals and errors are always shown.
- Always shown, not configurable: Needs you, waiting on cards, approvals, errors, Workspace unavailable, Wrapped up, Archived, Legacy. They tell the user to act or explain why the card behaves differently.
- `both` restores the earlier two-line behaviour (progress line, then output line).
- The page shows a live preview card built from sample data with the current options, and a *Reset to defaults* row.
- The board's Sort menu ends with *Card display…*, which opens Settings on the Cards page.
- The same page has a **Card sidebar** group for the open card's section order and which sections start open (DRAWER-SPEC, Section order).

## 4. Data contract

- `cardActivity: "auto" | "progress" | "output" | "both" | "none"`, default `auto`.
- `cardHidden: string[]` (≤ 20, each ≤ 40 chars), default `[]`. Unknown ids are kept and ignored, so a newer client's value never invalidates the whole board-view document on an older one.
- Pure helpers in `shared/card-display.ts`: `cardDisplay(view)` → per-field visibility; `activityLines(mode, hasProgress, hasOutput)` → which lines show.

## 5. Onboarding

New one-time tip `card-display`, shown when the current project has 6 or more active cards: “Cards too busy? Choose what they show in Settings → Cards, or from the Sort menu → Card display.” Welcome tour copy is unchanged: this is a view preference, not a new concept.

## 6. Acceptance

1. Default card: meta row, title, at most one activity line, status row; no priority/type pills or tag chips.
2. Each switch hides its field on the board and in the preview immediately; settings persist across reload.
3. Activity modes behave as in §3; `auto` shows output only when there is no progress summary.
4. Always-shown signals stay when every switch is off.
5. Invalid stored values fall back to defaults; older stored documents get the defaults.
6. All new strings in every catalog; `npm test` passes.

## 7. Open workspace button

Status: implemented 2026-10-29. Card: button to open associated workspace.

Each board card can take the user straight to its workspace in Paseo (the native workspace view with its tabs, terminals and sessions).

- **Where**: an `ArrowUpRight` icon button (the plugin's "Open in Paseo" icon) in the card's top-right action column, directly under the `…` actions button. Same size as `…` (26 pt desktop, 40 pt touch) and the same visibility: always on touch and on non-draggable cards, on hover or while the card is selected on the draggable desktop board.
- **Layout**: the column sits in the right padding the card already reserves for `…`, so titles keep their width. A card that shows the button is at least `2 × button + 8` tall (60 pt desktop, 88 pt touch), so the column never hangs below a short card.
- **Action**: `navigation.openWorkspace({ workspaceId: task.workspaceId, serverId: host.id })` (`openNativeWorkspace` in `client/session-state.ts`). Pressing it does not open the card sidebar and does not start a drag.
- **When it shows**: only when the host offers `navigation.openWorkspace` (older hosts and surfaces without navigation get nothing) and the card's workspace is in Paseo's live workspace list, the same test as the *Workspace unavailable* signal. Missing, archived and wrapped-up workspaces get no button.
- **Menus**: the card's context menu (right-click / long-press) and the `…` action sheet list **Open workspace** right after *Open details*, under the same conditions.
- Not on the Settings → Cards preview or the tour's demo cards (they pass no handler). Not configurable: it is an action, not a field. The card sidebar has its own button in its header, left of Edit ([DRAWER-SPEC](DRAWER-SPEC.md#open-workspace)).
- No onboarding tip or tour copy: the button is on the card itself. No telemetry field.

Acceptance:

1. A card with an available workspace shows the button under `…`; pressing it opens that workspace on the card's host.
2. No button (and no menu entry) without `navigation.openWorkspace` or when the workspace is unavailable.
3. Short cards grow to fit the column; titles do not get narrower.
4. Both strings (`Open workspace`, `Open workspace for {title}`) are in every catalog; `npm test` passes.
