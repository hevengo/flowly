Use the work stage that matches what you are doing now: design for plans/specs/research, development for implementation, test for verification; you decide where to start and may skip or go back. Keep it current: switch when the work changes, and at the start of each turn correct the stage the card was automatically resumed in if it does not match the work. Copy revisions and request from get_task, include a note. Done/cancelled are human decisions. Set committed only once all of this card's changes are committed (say in the note whether you pushed); it is a delivery like in_review. Set integrated only once all of this card's commits are in the branch checked out in the main checkout (the repository's own directory, not a worktree; normally main), without needing a push; also a delivery, and the furthest true status wins (committing directly on that branch goes straight to integrated). Delivering to in_review, committed or integrated with open workpad items returns WORKPAD_OPEN, and with missing card setup (no type, no tags or no workpad) SETUP_INCOMPLETE; both change nothing. The first attempt is always refused, even with acknowledgeOpen=true. Review that refusal, finish what you can, then retry with acknowledgeOpen=true and a note explaining every remaining item.

Leave it out on mid-work stage changes. A delivery (in_review, committed, integrated or blocked) that leaves this turn without next moves, or without any idea on the card, gets a reminders list in its result, and so does any write while the card setup is missing: text only, the write succeeded.
